# Work Day Scheduler 

## Is your 9 to 5 schedule a bit too hectic? Well look no further than this simple scheduler! 

# Installation

# Usage

## This scheduler runs on a 24-hour calendar. For example, at 9am to 5pm would be 09:00 to 17:00. During those times, each box will turn red if it's in the past, blue if it's within the current hour, or green if the timeslot is in the future. ![BlankCalendar](/assets/images/ScheduleEmpty.png)


## Once you fill in an event, you can save it by clicking the button on the right. It keeps it there until you delete the event. ![FilledCalendar](/assets/images/ScheduleFull.png)
